## Report 1 - Week of 08/31/2023 #

### Process Doc

In the first week, I delved into the realm of parametric design using Rhino 3D and Grasshopper 3D... 

ðŸ¤¯ Even though I had experience modeling with Rhino, I mainly used it to get familiar with understanding and constructing three-dimensional views without any requirement of accuracy. Thus, when I tried exporting my design for laser cutting one time, I could not fit the physical pieces together afterward. I was surprised to find that I experienced a steep learning curve as I opened up the Rhino application again a few years later and became completely unfamiliar with the interface and functions. I was used to starting with a blank canvas and immediately seeing geometries building. Working with computational design and the new tool Grasshopper, however, I could not understand the blank viewports in the beginning, the unselectable geometries, and the baking concept, until I read 

### Reflections
* reflections on what you learned and how you learned it
* an assessment of the state of your work

reflect on the experience of exploring a procedural model whose output is a cell phone stand design in Rhino
Consider: What other contextual observations would be useful to capture?
Consider: What other evaluations of results would be useful to provide as feedback?

### Speculations
* speculation on future direction for the tools [so much is changing very quickly right now, where do you think this is going? Why do you think this?]
* speculation on future direction for the work
* bonus: thoughtful descriptions of something interesting and relevant you heard about in the news or industry publications. include text, an image, a link, and a reference that you can follow up on later and share with your peers.

* Consider: Are there points in the process where you think AIâ€¦
Could be used to assist?
Could be trained on input and output?
Other?
